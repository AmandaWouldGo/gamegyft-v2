### Context
In 2015, Gift Card sales reached a new peak of $130 BILLION dollars. Holidays, birthdays, celebratory occasionsâ€¦ The versatile gift card is an easy gift, but can it been too easy?  

The underlying psychology of giving weaves  a complex web of emotions, not the least of which follows the concern of how our gift will be perceived by the receiver.  

GameGyft addresses this dynamic by adding personalization and delight to the gift card industry.
